    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
      This site is basically a credit academy / travel hacker's guide. It's designed to be an "on the rails" experience, where I show you what to do step by step, rather than a massive information dump for you to sift through. I call this the low hanging fruit - you don't need to keep spreadsheets or worry about small stuff like which card to use at which restaurant, it's the easy stuff that I consider just "money left on the table" by most. I'll also leave plenty of links to more information for those who want to go deeper into things. By the end, you'll have easily enough for a sweet trip to Hawaii or Europe or wherever, plus some cool perks like lounge access, and an improved credit score. Sweet, right? 
    </p>
    <h2>Prep</h2>
    <p>
      First things first: What is your FICO score (What’s a fico score?)
    </p>
      <h3>FICO scores explained:</h3>
      This is your credit rating, and it is super important. You should know your FICO score, and it should be at least 600+. 700+ is excellent, and 800+ is top notch. Get your latest score for free at CreditKarma.com

      <h3>Is this travel stuff good for my credit score?</h3>
      Yes, very much so, if you do it right. 
      <p>
      Most of your score is based on how much you owe vs how much credit is available to you, and a solid on-time payment history. The rest is how old your average card is, what mix of credit you have, and how many new accounts/credit inquiries you have recently. For more details look <a href="http://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/whatsinyourscore.aspx">here</a>
      </p>
      <img src="http://www.myfico.com/images/CreditEducation/ce_FICO-Score-chart.png">
      <p>
      Follow the advice here, and your score will eventually get to 800+, while you enjoy free travel and perks along the way. You can get some decent cards with lower scores, but the offers get better as your score gets better - this score also determines how much interest you pay, and that becomes hugely important when you’re looking to get a loan (like when you buy a home).
      </p>
      <p>
      To get the best score, you want to have a good history with as many banks as you can - so having 10 good relationships is better than having one. Just make sure you pay all of your cards on time (auto pay is king), and get going on accumulating card history as early as possible. 
      </p>
      <p>
      At all costs, pay your credit cards down to zero each month. You will save a ton of money on interest, and the low credit-utilization will send your rising fico score to the moon in time.
    </p>
    <h2>Stack Points</h2>
    <h3>Getting the cards:</h3>
    <p>
      The short version:
      Get Chase Sapphire Preferred, then Ink Plus Business, then Freedom (The trifecta!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Apply with the links and referral codes you should be getting in your inbox in the next day or so. I would do one new card every other month, try to space these out so you don't get rejected for opening too many at the same time. The order is important because the points from cards like the Freedom aren't worth as much on their own - but Chase allows you to consolidate your points to any of your card accounts. It's when you move them over to your Sapphire card that they become way more valuable. Having the Sapphire card is like having a supercharger for your other points. 
    </p>
    <h3>Completing the sign on bonus spending:</h3>
    <p>
      Usually a card will do something like "Spend $3k in 90 days and get 50k points." My biggest hack here is to use plastiq or radpad to pay your bills and rent with your card. Then spend whatever you would normally spend and you should be able to do a new card every month or two. If you fall short, there are other little hacks to "spend money" by looping it back to yourself (look up manufactured spend for a fun rabbit hole of info) - this started out with simple things like buying dollar coins with your credit card, then paying your credit card with those dollar coins. It's more complicated now, but it's the same idea. You spend nearly nothing and get credit for spending on the card. 
    </p>
    <h3>For the Ink Plus Business Card:</h3>
    <p>
      You don't have to have a business to get a business credit card. Just apply and treat it like any other one. In the application, you can either use a real company or just use your social security number for your business number, make up a company name, and say you do consulting or something as a side business. Just don't make up a big number for your business' expected income - something like $100 per year is fine.
    </p>
    <h2>Free Trip</h2>
    <h3>You've done it! Time to enjoy some earned down time</h3>
    <p>
      You can go about booking your trip a few different ways, but the easiest is to just use the card company's rewards site. If you want to get more mileage (dad joke!) you can look for points deals on specific airlines, then transfer your points to your account for that airline's loyalty program. For example, if Hawaiian Air is having a sale for its point holders, you can transfer your points to your account there, then book on their website. There are some crazy deals that come up occasionally via this method, and there are sites out there that will keep you alerted when these deals come about - but I find them to be a bunch of noise when I'm not traveling, and not what I'm looking for when I am traveling. 
    </p>
    <h3>Perks</h3>
    <p>
      Cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or Amex Platinum card give you access to airport lounges all over the globe, and it makes all the difference. These lounges offer things from nap rooms and showers, to open bars and buffets. It's the best feeling sitting at the airport sipping free champagne - and some cards allow you to bring in guests. When you're alone at the airport, ask if anyone at the gate wants free drinks and invite them to come as your guest - pay it forward! You could even tell them about this site and how you got to be there :)
