            This site is basically a credit academy / travel hacker's guide. It's designed to be an "on the rails" experience, where I show you what to do step by step, rather than a massive information dump for you to sift through. I call this the low hanging fruit - you don't need to keep spreadsheets or worry about small stuff like which card to use at which restaurant, it's the easy stuff that I consider just "money left on the table" by most. I'll also leave plenty of links to more information for those who want to go deeper into things. By the end, you'll have easily enough for a sweet trip to Hawaii or Europe or wherever, plus some cool perks like lounge access, and an improved credit score. Sweet, right?
